### Who is the Actuary?
Wikipedia says: "An actuary is a business professional with advanced statistical skills who deals with the measurement and management of risk and uncertainty."

Translation: Actuaries are the lions of the working world: problem-solving, intelligent, and highly paid (it's actually unclear how much lions are paid).
- Working in Insurance, Finance, Consulting, and the Government
- Earning over [$105,000](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm){:target="_blank"} per year
- Avoiding burnout by solving varied and new problems every day

### Exams
Actuaries evolve like Pokemon, leveling up their income with the passage of each actuarial exam.  These exams are challenging, but thousands of actuaries pass them each year!
Check out full membership pathways to [SOA](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/default/){:target="_blank"} and [CAS](https://www.casact.org/exams-admissions/exams){:target="_blank"}

### CAS and SOA
Professional Actuaries belong to two societies:
- [Society of Actuaries (SOA)](https://www.soa.org/member/){:target="_blank"}, Life and Health insurance
- [Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS)](https://www.casact.org/){:target="_blank"}, Property and Casualty insurance
<br> 

Don't worry about picking your path right now!  Each of the first two actuarial exams are accepted by both SOA and CAS.
