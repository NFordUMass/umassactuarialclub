## Exams

### Reimbursement!
The best part about going to UMass?  It's not the [number one dining](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-ranked-no-1-best-campus-food-sixth-year){:target="_blank"}, or the fellow students, or the faculty.  No, it's the reimbursed exams.

[Coaching Actuaries](https://www.coachingactuaries.com/){:target="_blank"} is a phenomenal online prep course (with video lessons, practice quizzes) which all but guarantees you will pass the exam.

Now, we're legally obligated to mention that we are not sponsored.  However, if we could sell-out to one company, it would be to Coaching Actuaries.
