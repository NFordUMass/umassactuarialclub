# UMass's Actuarial Club Website

In the summer of 2023, I decided to build the website for a club I was involved with on campus, the UMass Actuarial Club, the Beta Chi chapter of the Gamma Iota Sigma fraternity. Note, this was the second website I made this summer, in addition to that for the McCormack Sports Analytics club.

I chose Github Pages to fork an existing website template. I found the Millennial Template by Paul Le to be exactly the vibe I wanted.

On the backbone of this template, I created about five different pages in markdown to house the website.

This was a great learning experience for me, in not only using git and creating a project with precise version control, but also in working with HMTL and Markdown.

While there are still some elements here and there I would like to improve (namely the hardcoded source to every image file path), I think this turned out pretty well.

As I'm no longer a part of the club, my local github domain for the website doesn't contain up-to-date information about the club's happenings.

Feel free to reach out with any feedback or questions.
